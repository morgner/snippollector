Title: README

snippollector (short for Snippet Collector) is entirely written in python and uses the django framework for doing its job.

Please note that snippollector uses pygments for syntax highlighting.

To install pygments use one of the following commands

if you are an easy_install user use the following command:
	sudo easy_install pygments
or if you are a pip user use this command:
	sudo pip install pygments

Syntax highligting is brought to snippollector by the django-syntax-colorize template filter, written by Will Larson - http://github.com/lethain/django-syntax-colorize

Thats all...

... for now
