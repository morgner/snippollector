Title: README

snippollector (short for Snippet Collector) is entirely written in python and uses the django framework for doing its job.

Please note that snippollector uses pygments for syntax highlighting.

To install pygments use one of the following commands

	if you are an easy_install user: sudo easy_install pygments
	
	OR
	
	if you are a pip user: sudo pip install pygments

Thats all...

... for now
